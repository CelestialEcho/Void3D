# Void3D C++ Library
Void3D is a "donut.c" inspired 3d engine. It works only in windows terminal/powershell and has everything that you need, to create cool 3d scenes in you terminal. I have writen it using nvim (NvChad) and C++. Please keep in mind that this is my first project, which is includes complex math, and 3D Technologies. This might be a bit stupid project. But I do like Console Projects, so I hope that u wont say that it's useless.

## Some useful information if you gonna use it
